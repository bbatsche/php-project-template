# Security Policy

Because of their sensitive nature, security issues should **not** be discussed in public forums. If you believe you have found an issue that exposes sensitive information or that could be leveraged in accessing such information, please email it directly to the project maintainer at <ben.batschelet@gmail.com>. We will respond promptly and do our utmost to resolve any security issues in a timely manner.
